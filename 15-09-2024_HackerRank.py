#Challenge-1
'''
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j, k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i + j + k is not equal to n. Here, 0 i c; 0 j y; 0 k z. Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise. Example
All permutations of [i, j, k] are:


Sample Input:
1
1
1
2
Sample Output:
[0, o, 0], [o, o, 1], [0, 1, o, n, o, 0], n, 1, 11]
