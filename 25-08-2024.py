''' Instructions
Your friend Chandler plans to visit exotic countries all around the world. Sadly, Chandler's math skills aren't good. He's pretty worried about being scammed by currency exchanges during his trip - and he wants you to make a currency calculator for him. Here are his specifications for the app:
'''



def exchange_money(budget, exchange_rate):
    """

    :param budget: float - amount of money you are planning to exchange.
    :param exchange_rate: float - unit value of the foreign currency.
    :return: float - exchanged value of the foreign currency you can receive.
    """
    return budget/exchange_rate
exchange_money(127.5, 1.2)
    
def get_change(budget, exchanging_value):
    """

    :param budget: float - amount of money you own.
    :param exchanging_value: float - amount of your money you want to exchange now.
    :return: float - amount left of your starting currency after exchanging.
    """
    return budget - exchanging_value
get_change(127.5, 120)
