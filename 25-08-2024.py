''' Instructions
Your friend Chandler plans to visit exotic countries all around the world. Sadly, Chandler's math skills aren't good. He's pretty worried about being scammed by currency exchanges during his trip - and he wants you to make a currency calculator for him. Here are his specifications for the app:
'''



def exchange_money(budget, exchange_rate):
    """

    :param budget: float - amount of money you are planning to exchange.
    :param exchange_rate: float - unit value of the foreign currency.
    :return: float - exchanged value of the foreign currency you can receive.
    """
    return budget/exchange_rate
exchange_money(127.5, 1.2)
    
def get_change(budget, exchanging_value):
    """

    :param budget: float - amount of money you own.
    :param exchanging_value: float - amount of your money you want to exchange now.
    :return: float - amount left of your starting currency after exchanging.
    """
    return budget - exchanging_value
get_change(127.5, 120)
    
def get_value_of_bills(denomination, number_of_bills):
    """

    :param denomination: int - the value of a bill.
    :param number_of_bills: int - total number of bills.
    :return: int - calculated value of the bills.
    """
    return denomination * number_of_bills
get_value_of_bills(5, 128)

def get_number_of_bills(amount, denomination):
    """

    :param amount: float - the total starting value.
    :param denomination: int - the value of a single bill.
    :return: int - number of bills that can be obtained from the amount.
    """
    
    return int(amount / denomination)
